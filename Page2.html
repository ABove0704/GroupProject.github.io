		<div class="box"> The next new trend is already being presented to you before you can even take your next breath. Electric media is for people that want to access content online. This content has environmentally affected us with the change of content being released at a fast pace. No person is safe out in the world and everyone in their neighborhood can look out what is posted on your social media page. This causes issues for people not knowing how to keep their mouth shut on social media and thinking it's ok to post and rant about what is going on with their lives every minute of the day. Anxiety affects everyone around the globe. Anxiety was yesterday's problem. This means that we are constantly worried about what needs to be done in our lives and what needs to be accomplished to succeed and live a stable life. Even bullying is shown online because people can say mean words about other people's pages on social media.</div>
