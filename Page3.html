		<div class="box"> Printing became the new visual stress for portal books that inspire people to use their imagination and creativity. This new media brought about ways of printing books much faster than usual. This caused people in the church to create bibles so everyone in their hometown can have a copy of the bible. This revolutionized the way posters and banners can be distributed around towns. Sounds are being heard constantly around us without focusing on anything. This is true because sounds like the AC or the radiator can be heard in peoples' workplaces. The important topic that is touched upon in this book is memoization. Everyone around the world has a memory and can recall certain objectives and activities throughout their lives. Without memory, no one will be able to recall what they had for breakfast yesterday. The book is trying to open people's eyes to what is really going on around the world. This book's message is focusing on the meaning of life and how people should be approaching certain activities to be their best selves.</div>
