		<div class="box"> The book, The Medium is the Massage, talks about the different aspects of our personal lives. The book goes into how privacy and media in society are shaped today. No one has privacy anymore and everyone is constantly being watched by online companies taking data of our voice commands and videos through our phones. Peopleâ€™s minds never get a break with the use of smartphones these days. This can mentally hurt people's mental health because they are never getting a second to themselves anymore. Jobs are affecting people mentally because they can constantly be sending emails and working remotely through their smartphones. They can even be contacted when they are on vacation and this causes people to have no privacy when they want to get away from reality. </div>
